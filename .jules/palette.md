## 2026-02-02 - Icon-Only Buttons
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like 'Back', 'Close', 'Send') are frequently used in this project but often lack `aria-label`, making them inaccessible to screen readers.
**Action:** Systematically check all icon-only buttons for `aria-label` during development and code review.
