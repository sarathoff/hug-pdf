## 2025-02-18 - Blocking Synchronous Calls in FastAPI
**Learning:** Verified that `async def` route handlers in FastAPI run in the main event loop. Calling synchronous blocking I/O (like `requests.get` in `PexelsService`) directly blocks the entire application, negating the benefits of concurrency. Furthermore, `PPTGeneratorService` was attempting to fetch images concurrently using `asyncio.gather` but was calling the synchronous `search_images` method, resulting in sequential blocking execution instead of parallel fetching.
**Action:** Always wrap synchronous I/O operations in `asyncio.to_thread` when integrating legacy synchronous services into async FastAPI endpoints. Introduced `search_images_async` wrapper and applied `cachetools` to significantly reduce API latency and unblock the event loop.
